Apereo CAS WAR Overlay Template
=====================================
# Versions
- CAS Server `7.1.3`
- JDK `21`

# Build

To build the project, use:

```bash
# Use --refresh-dependencies to force-update SNAPSHOT versions
./gradlew[.bat] clean build
```

To see what commands/tasks are available to the build script, run:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] tasks
```

If you need to, on Linux/Unix systems, you can delete all the existing artifacts
(artifacts and metadata) Gradle has downloaded using:

```bash
# Only do this when absolutely necessary
rm -rf $HOME/.gradle/caches/
```

Same strategy applies to Windows too, provided you switch `$HOME` to its equivalent in the above command.

# Keystore

For the server to run successfully, you might need to create a keystore file.
This can either be done using the JDK's `keytool` utility or via the following command:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] createKeystore
```

Use the password `changeit` for both the keystore and the key/certificate entries. 
Ensure the keystore is loaded up with keys and certificates of the server.

# Deployment

On a successful deployment via the following methods, the server will be available at:

* `https://localhost:8443/cas`


## Executable WAR

Run the server web application as an executable WAR. Note that running an executable WAR requires CAS to use an embedded container such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, etc.

The current servlet container is specified as `-tomcat`.

```bash
java -jar build/libs/cas.war
```

Or via:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] run
```
